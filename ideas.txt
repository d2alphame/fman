Ideas for a terminal file manager

1. Should support configuration
2. Can be scripted using perl
3. Can be communicated with using sockets
4. Written in a fast low level language
5. Can save current "workspace" on exit
6. Loads saved workspace on start
7. Loads home directory on first use
8. Mod + x to `chmod +x` a selected file (or last created file)
9. Mod + s to `chmod 400` a selected file
10. Mod + d to create a new directory in current pane
11. Mod + shift d to create a new directory in other pane
12. Mod + f to create a new file in current pane
13. Mod + shift f to create a new file in other pane
14. Mod + shift c copy selected file to other pane
15. Mod + v Paste selected files in this pane
16. Esc to cancel selection
17. Shift + (up or down arrow keys) to enter selection mode
18. Arrow keys to continue selecting
19. Enter to accept selection
20. Mod + o to open the directory in this pane also in the other pane

There should also be a directory hotlist. Use Function keys to open items in the 
hotlist. E.g F1 opens first item in directory hotlist. F2 opens second item in
directory hostlist, etc. Use shift + Function key to open the entry in 'other' pane
To add an entry, specify a label (this is what is shown in the hot list pane) and
a path (the directory to go to)

The panes have no borders. Borders are drawn around selected panes
Use `tab` to switch between panes

Use `enter` to navigate into a folder in the current pane

Use shift + enter to navigate into a folder in the other pane

Space bar pops up a preview window for the selected pane. If no
pane is selected, it would be for the primary pane.

Press `esc` to close the preview window
