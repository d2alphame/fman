Ideas for a terminal file manager

1. Should support configuration
2. Can be scripted using perl
3. Can be communicated with using sockets
4. Written in a fast low level language
5. Can save current "workspace" on exit
6. Mod + x to `chmod +x` a selected file (or last created file)
7. Mod + s to `chmod 400` a selected file
8. Mod + d to create a new directory in current pane
9. Mod + shift d to create a new directory in other pane
10. Mod + f to create a new file in current pane
11. Mod + shift f to create a new file in other pane
12. Mod + shift c copy selected file to other pane



The panes have no borders. Borders are drawn around selected panes
Use `tab` to switch between panes

Use `enter` to navigate into a folder in the current pane

Use shift + enter to navigate into a folder in the other pane

Space bar pops up a preview window for the selected pane. If no
pane is selected, it would be for the primary pane.

Press `esc` to close the preview window
