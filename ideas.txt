Ideas for a terminal file manager

1. Should support configuration
2. Can be scripted using perl
3. Can be communicated with using sockets
4. Written in a fast low level language
5. Can save current "workspace" on exit
6. Loads saved workspace on start
7. Loads home directory on first use
8. Mod + x to `chmod +x` a selected file (or last created file)
9. Mod + 4 to `chmod 400` a selected file. Usually used SSH key files
10. Mod + d to create a new directory in current pane
11. Mod + shift d to create a new directory in other pane
12. Mod + f to create a new file in current pane
13. Mod + shift f to create a new file in other pane
14. Mod + shift c copy selected file to other pane
15. Mod + v Paste selected files in this pane
16. Esc to cancel selection


Use left arrow key to add items to selection. Use right arrow key to drop
selected items from selection

There should also be a directory hotlist. Use Function keys to open items in the 
hotlist. E.g F1 opens first item in directory hotlist. F2 opens second item in
directory hostlist, etc. Use shift + Function key to open the entry in 'other' pane
To add an entry, specify a label (this is what is shown in the hot list pane) and
a path (the directory to go to)

The panes have no borders. Borders are drawn around selected panes
Use `tab` to switch between panes

Use `enter` to navigate into a folder in the current pane

Use shift + enter to navigate into a folder in the other pane

Space bar turns other pane into preview mode.

Mod + space duplicates current pane in the other pane

Press `esc` to close the preview window

Below the hotlist pane is the info pane. It shows the amount of space on the disk,
the amount of space used and the amount of space left


Fman has 2 modes - Navigation mode and Directory mode.
Press the Mod key to toggle between both.

There are 2 sets of buttons used for navigation by default and these can be changed
in the configuration.

esdf and ijkl for up, left, down, and right respectively.
